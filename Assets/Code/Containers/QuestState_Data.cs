public class QuestState_Data {

    //This _likely_ stores the detailed state of world events and normal quests
    //Needs a abstract state machine class that is data driven and everything...
    //... should not be implemented before our foindation is not solid!!!
    // Yes, our plans for the God-Quests are awesome but we need a solid framework first!

    //Hopefully by then we grasp that data driven stuff, like Bytecode here
    //http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/bytecode.html
    //and then can make the quest system fully data driven

    //TODO: The biggest part of the foundation should be done before even thinking about this!!
